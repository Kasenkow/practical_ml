# Weight Lifting Quality Assessment

The ability to automatically classify physical activity movements into categories in respect of their proper performance form (so-called qualitative activity recognition) can have potential benefits in reduction of weightlifting-related injuries.

This project is aimed at identifying correctly the type of the form in which a simple weightlifting excercise (unilateral bicep curl with dumbbell) was performed. There are 5 types of form, 1 of which was correct, the others illustrated common mistakes.

The results show a great quality of classification.
